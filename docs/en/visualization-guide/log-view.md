# Log view

This document is a part of [User guide](/docs/en/visualization-guide/user-guide.md).

The log view shows logs related to the selected timeline. To open a log view, clicking on a [Timelivew View](/docs/en/visualization-guide/timeline-view.md)'s element.

The log view consists of three sections:

- [Log List](#log-list)
- [Log Info](#log-info)
- [Log Body](#log-body)

![User guide log-view](/docs/en/images/guide-log-view.png)

## Log List

Log List contains the following information:

- Log type (read [Supported Log Types](TBA) for more details)
- Severity (empty if severity is unknown)
- Timestamp
- Summary of the log
  - The log summary is generated by the KHI backend using the entire YAML log data. This summary may differ from the string displayed in Cloud Logging.

| Icon | Name | Action |
|---|---|---|
| ![log list filter](/docs/images/icons/filter.png) | Auto timeline filter | When this button is enabled, the log list automatically filters to only show logs related to the timeline that is selected in the timeline view |
| ![log list sort](/docs/images/icons/sort.png) | Includes descendants | When this button is enabled, the log list automatically filters to show logs related to the currently selected timeline in the timeline view, as well as any logs related to its descendant timelines |

## Log Info

Log Info contains various information and tool buttons to the selected log.

A single log entry can be associated with multiple timelines, depending on its content. For example, a log of kubelet starting a container is associated with both the Pod containing the container and the Node. If there are multiple elements in `Related resources` section, you can focus on the corresponding timeline by clicking on any of those elements.
